# üì° CCNP GNS3 LAB ‚Äì Multi-Domain Network Scenario  

This GNS3 lab demonstrates **advanced CCNP-level networking skills** with:  
- Multi-protocol routing (OSPF, EIGRP, BGP)  
- Route redistribution & path manipulation  
- Spanning-tree design (MSTP, PVST+)  
- BGP attributes & communities  
- Plus beyond CCNP scope: **VPN IPsec** & **MPLS backbone**  

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Overview  
This repository documents a complete GNS3 lab project.  
Each section corresponds to a key configuration step, with explanations and configs provided.  

## üñºÔ∏è Network Topology  
The following diagram represents the global lab infrastructure:

## üîπ Lab Sections  

### 1. OSPF / EIGRP Interzone  
- Redistribution between OSPF and EIGRP domains.  
- Higher EIGRP metric configured ‚Üí OSPF preferred as default path.  

### 2. OSPF Multi-Area Design  
- Areas **0, 10, 20** deployed with backup links **R9 ‚Üî R8**.  
- Default route originated on **R2** and **R8**, with R2 preferred.  

### 3. BGP Inter-AS Configuration  
- Multiple AS domains: **65100, 65200, 65300**.  
- Routes exchanged between ASes via eBGP sessions.  

### 4. BGP Path Selection Tuning  
- **Local Preference** & **MED** influence routing.  
- Example: AS65200 ‚Üí prefers R2 (higher LP), backup via R8.  

### 5. BGP Communities & Advanced Attributes  

BGP communities are used as a **scalable tagging mechanism** to classify routes, then apply policies at border routers.  
This avoids hardcoding policies on individual prefixes and allows consistent enforcement across the network.  

**Example implementation in the lab:**  

- **On R3 (AS65300)** ‚Üí routes from R1 are tagged:  

```cisco
route-map TAG-DTC-65100 permit 10
 match ip address prefix-list TO-DATACENTER-65100
 set community 65300:65100 additive
```

Communities are then **propagated with `send-community`** to iBGP peers.

- **On R14** ‚Üí policies match the tagged routes and apply attributes:  

```cisco
ip community-list standard DTC permit 65300:65100
!
route-map TO-DTC-65100 permit 10
 match community DTC
 set local-preference 111
```

#### Why use communities?  
- **Simplifies configuration**:  
  - All ‚ÄúDatacenter-bound‚Äù prefixes are tagged `65300:65100`.  
  - Border routers simply match the tag and apply LP/Weight accordingly.  
- **Ensures consistent policy enforcement** across multiple routers and domains.  
- **Provides scalability**: adding new prefixes does not require updating every border router policy, only tagging them once.  

#### Attributes combined with communities  
- **Weight** ‚Üí Cisco-specific, local to a router; used for fine-tuning on edge routers.  
- **Local Preference** ‚Üí AS-wide decision; propagated via iBGP and can be extended to other BGP peers.  
- **Communities** ‚Üí decide which routes receive which attributes, enabling flexible and scalable routing control.  

### 6. LAN Switching ‚Äì MSTP & PVST+  
- **MSTP** deployed in Spain LAN.  
- **PVST+** for redundancy & per-VLAN spanning-tree.  

### 7. VPN IPsec (France ‚Üî Canada/US)  
- Site-to-Site tunnels between remote branches.  
- **IKEv2, encryption policies, SLA tracking**.  

### 8. MPLS VPN Backbone  
- MPLS between **Main Branch ‚Üî Datacenter ‚Üî Spain LAN**.  
- VRF isolation & PE-CE connectivity simulated.
